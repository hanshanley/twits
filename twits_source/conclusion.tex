\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we analyzed what factors potentially contribute to 
why users post toxic content on Twitter. We propose and implement a new open-source toxicity classifier, achieving better accuracy than the Perspective API on the Civil Comments dataset.  Then, analyzing 89.6M tweets posted by 43.1K users from across the political spectrum, we find a user or topic being heavily partisan does not necessarily imply increased toxicity; rather as users engage with and as conversations involve a wider range of political orientations and with other toxic users and toxic content that online toxicity increases.
